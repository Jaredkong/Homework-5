## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Business Context

Poor time management can result in missed meetings and deadlines or create the appearance of unprofessionalism. A daily planner allows employees to see their day at a glance, schedule time effectively, and improve productivity.



```
GIVEN that an employee adds events to a specific hour in a calendar

WHEN the employee clicks the save button

THEN events are saved in the timeblock for that hour
```

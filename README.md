## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Description 

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability to use JQuery to dynamically create HTML.  As well as to save and retrieve from local storage.  It also showcases ability to utilize bootstrap, and to use a third party API.

The application is a calendar that allows a user to input an event for any hour between 9AM to 5pm.  The user is able to save this event, which pushes the input into local storage.  This allows the data to be saved even when the browser is refreshed.  In addition, the calendar is color-coded so that a user may easily see which tasks or events have passed, are in the present, or in the near future.  

## Built with 
Bootstrap
JQuery
moment.js

## Future Development

The calendar could be coded to include other days besides the current one.  Another lacking feature is a clear local storage function, so that a user can reset their calendar.
